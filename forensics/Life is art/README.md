### Q. L1F3_15_4R7

Q. My headphones are broken. So is my laptop.

Files to be uploaded (without metadata removal):

* output.flac

### Internal Explanation

This challenge involves a multi-layered encoding process to hide the flag. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the challenge was created and how it's intended to be solved:

1.  The Flag:
    The complete flag is: ⁠wtfCTF{YouKnowTheGreatestSecretIsNothingAtAllAndThatsEverything}
2.  Encoding Process:
    a) First part of the flag: ⁠wtfCTF{YouKnowTheGreatestSecretIs
    
    * This part is encoded in hexadecimal.
    * The hex-encoded string is then used to create an image.
    * Each 6 characters of the hex string represent a color in the image.
    * This creates a visual pattern that participants need to decode.
    
    b) Second part of the flag: NothingAtAllAndThatsEverything}
    
    * This part is encoded in binary.
    * The binary string is then converted into an audio file using a custom Python script.
3.  Audio Encoding (Python Script Explanation):
    
    
    import numpy as np
    import soundfile as sf
    
    def binary_to_flac(binary, filename="output.flac", sample_rate=44100):
        high = 523  # C5 note
        low = 392   # G4 note
    
        # Convert binary string to list of integers, with None for spaces
        data = [int(bit) if bit != ' ' else None for bit in binary]
    
        # Create time array based on the sample rate and duration of each note
        note_duration = 0.2  # 200ms per note
        t = np.linspace(0, note_duration, num=int(note_duration*sample_rate), endpoint=False)
        t = np.tile(t, len(data))
    
        # Generate waveform
        waveform = np.zeros_like(t)
        for i, bit in enumerate(data):
            if bit is not None:
                frequency = high if bit else low
                start = i * int(note_duration*sample_rate)
                end = (i + 1) * int(note_duration*sample_rate)
                waveform[start:end] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t[:int(note_duration*sample_rate)])
    
        # Add a slight decay to each note
        envelope = np.exp(-5 * np.linspace(0, 1, int(note_duration*sample_rate)))
        envelope = np.tile(envelope, len(data))
        waveform *= envelope
    
        # Scale the waveform to int16 range
        waveform_scaled = np.int16(waveform/np.max(np.abs(waveform)) * 32767)
    
        # Write the .flac file
        sf.write(filename, waveform_scaled, sample_rate)
    
    # Test with a binary string
    binary_string = "01001110 01101111 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111 01000001 01110100 01000001 01101100 01101100 01000001 01101110 01100100 01010100 01101000 01100001 01110100 01110011 01000101 01110110 01100101 01110010 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111 01111101"
    binary_to_flac(binary_string)
    
    
    
    This script does the following:
    
    * Converts the binary string into an audio file (FLAC format).
    * Uses two musical notes: C5 (523 Hz) for '1' and G4 (392 Hz) for '0'.
    * Each bit is represented by a 200ms note.
    * Adds a slight decay to each note for a more natural sound.
4.  Additional Clues:
    
    * A riddle is hidden in the FLAC file's metadata: "listen and watch you must, tap the beat until the world turns to dust"
    * This clue suggests that participants need to both listen to the audio and look at something visual.
5.  Challenge Description Hints:
    
    * "My headphones are broken" hints at the audio component of the challenge.
    * "So is my laptop" suggests that there's a visual component as well, likely referring to the image created from the hex-encoded part of the flag.
6.  Solving the Challenge:
    Participants need to:
    a) Extract and decode the image from the FLAC file's album cover to get the first part of the flag.
    b) Listen to the audio and convert the two tones back into binary, then to ASCII for the second part of the flag.
    c) Combine both parts to get the complete flag.

Final key: ⁠wtfCTF{YouKnowTheGreatestSecretIsNothingAtAllAndThatsEverything}

This challenge tests multiple skills:

* Steganography (hidden data in image and audio)
* Audio analysis
* Binary and hexadecimal encoding/decoding
* Attention to detail (noticing the metadata clue)
