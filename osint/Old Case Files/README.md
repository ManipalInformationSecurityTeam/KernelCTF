Hint 3: "Papa, Papa! My teacher asked me to bring a map for class, but I couldn't find one! So what does Papa do? Opens the belt like it’s a treasure chest! I guess that’s his way of saying I’ll navigate my own way out of this one!"



Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve the puzzle based on the story **Journey of Shadows** and the clues provided:

### Step 1: Analyze the Structure
The story revolves around a mysterious criminal who travels through different famous cities, committing heists. The key to solving this puzzle involves identifying the locations and understanding the connection between these incidents and the identity of the criminal.
